### Issues
Found a bug, have some feedback or really want some feature? Lock in an Issue. Here are some tips:

- Make sure the bug you're reporting really is a bug and you have read the docs/readme.
- Provide as many details as you can about the bug. How can it be reproduced? What have you tried so far?
- For feature requests, really explain why your feature is important and how it improves the library and helps the developers using it.
- Go through existing issues. Make sure that it hasn't already been opened.
- If planning on helping close an issue, don't be shy. Ask questions and get more information before sending your PR.
### Pull Requests

Want to fix a bug, implement a feature or help with the tests / docs? Please read this first:

- Make sure there's an open issue for what you're sending in your Pull Request. If not, open it.
- Send in your PRs agains the `master` branch.
- Write unit tests / docs for any new feature you implement.
- Make sure your PRs pass all tests and CI.
- Be active in your relevant issue and PR threads.
- Make sure no one else is assigned or working on the issue. It's a good idea to leave a comment stating that you're going to implement it before sending in your PR. 
- This way no two devs are working on the same thing.
- If required, update the CHANGELOG.md file with a small summary of your changes in the latest version (add a new section if needed)
