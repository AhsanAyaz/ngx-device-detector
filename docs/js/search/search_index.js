improve Examples / Documentation\nShare repo with others.\n\nIssues\nFound a bug, have some feedback or really want some feature? Lock in an Issue. Here are some tips:\n\nMake sure the bug you're reporting really is a bug and you have read the docs/readme.\nProvide as many details as you can about the bug. How can it be reproduced? What have you tried so far?\nFor feature requests, really explain why your feature is important and how it improves the library and helps the developers using it.\nGo through existing issues. Make sure that it hasn't already been opened.\nIf planning on helping close an issue, don't be shy. Ask questions and get more information before sending your PR.Pull Requests\n\n\nWant to fix a bug, implement a feature or help with the tests / docs? Please read this first:\n\nMake sure there's an open issue for what you're sending in your Pull Request. If not, open it.\nSend in your PRs agains the master branch.\nWrite unit tests / docs for any new feature you implement.\nMake sure your PRs pass all tests and CI.\nBe active in your relevant issue and PR threads.\nMake sure no one else is assigned or working on the issue. It's a good idea to leave a comment stating that you're going to implement it before sending in your PR. \nThis way no two devs are working on the same thing.\nIf required, update the CHANGELOG.md file with a small summary of your changes in the latest version (add a new section if needed)\n\nFinally, Thank you!\nIt means a lot that you took time out to improve this package and contribute back

} from 'ngx-device-detector';\n  ...\n  @Component({\n    selector: 'home',  // \n    styleUrls: [ './home.component.scss' ],\n    templateUrl: './home.component.html',\n    ...\n  })\n\n  export

If using ExpressJS for example:\nuniversal-device-detector.service.ts:\nimport { Inject, Injectable, Optional, PLATFORM_ID } from '@angular/core';\nimport { REQUEST } from '@nguniversal/express-engine/tokens';\nimport { Request } from 'express';\nimport { DeviceDetectorService } from 'ngx-device-detector';\nimport { isPlatformServer } from '@angular/common';\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class UniversalDeviceDetectorService extends DeviceDetectorService {\n  constructor(@Inject(PLATFORM_ID) platformId: any, @Optional() @Inject(REQUEST) request: Request) {\n    super(platformId);\n    if (isPlatformServer(platformId)) {\n      super.setDeviceInfo((request.headers['user-agent'] as string) || '');\n    }\n  }\n}app.server.module.ts:\n{\n  provide: DeviceDetectorService,\n  useClass: UniversalDeviceDetectorService\n},Device service\nHolds the following properties\n\nbrowser\nos\ndevice\nuserAgent\nos_version\n\nHelper Methods\n\nisMobile() : returns if the device is a mobile device (android / iPhone/ windows-phone etc)\nisTablet() : returns if the device us a tablet (iPad etc)\nisDesktop() : returns if the app is running on a Desktop browser.\n\nDevelopment\nTo generate all *.js, *.js.map and *.d.ts files:\n  $ npm run tscTo lint all *.ts files:\n  $ npm run lintTo run unit tests\n  $ npm run testTo build the library\n  $ npm run buildRun the DEMO\nMake sure you have @angular/cli installed\n  $ npm install -g @angular/cli  $ cd demo\n  $ npm install\n  $ ng servethe demo will be up at localhost:4200\nChange Log\nPlease see CHANGE_LOG.MD for the updates.\nIE10, IE11 Compatibility\nIf you're consuming the library for IE10 & IE11, please refer to the polyfills.ts file in your project.\nFor example, for an Angular 9.x+ project, you can refer to the changes done in this PR for our demo project that works on IE11\nCredits\nThe library is inspired by and based on the work from ng-device-detector . Also used a typescript wrapper of the amazing work in ReTree for regex based needs and an Angular2 Library Creator boilerplate to get the work started fast. I.e.
